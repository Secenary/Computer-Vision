    K-Means algorithm can be broken down into following steps:
        1. Randomly initialize cluster centers

        3. Compute new center of each cluster
        4. Stop if cluster assignments did not change
        5. Go to step 2

    Args:

            vector.
        k - Number of clusters to form.
        num_iters - Maximum number of iterations the algorithm will run.
